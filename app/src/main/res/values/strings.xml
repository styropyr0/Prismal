    <string name="i_see">I see what happened ðŸ‘€ â€” the image you generated looks **grainy/static**, almost like random noise rather than smooth ripples. Thatâ€™s expected if you just took raw random differences (`dx`, `dy`) â†’ they produce a *salt-and-pepper* style normal map. For a **glassy/liquid look**, you want **smooth, continuous distortions** (like water waves), not high-frequency grain. --- ### Why it looks grainy * The base texture you used was pure random noise â†’ each pixel uncorrelated. * When you derive slopes (`dx`, `dy`), it just amplifies that randomness. * The result is a grain normal map, good for **frosted glass** (scattered look), but not for **liquid glass** (smooth rippling). ---</string>
